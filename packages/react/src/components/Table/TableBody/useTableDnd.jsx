 * This is similar to `useState` but pairs the value with a ref to the value. The benefit of this is
 * that callback functions do not need to include refs in their dependency lists, but can access
 * their most recent values safely.
 *
 * This is important for some data used in manually added event listeners, like for "mousemove". If
 * listeners depend on normal state, they must be removed and added frequently to create a closure
 * around the new state. But by using a ref they only need to close around the mutable ref, then use
 * that to access the value they needs. For drag and drop, we need to ensure there are no
 * dependencies that would cause the `setupDnd` effect to tear down and set up repeatedly since they
 * will cause visual and performance problems.
 *
 * Note that this still returns a stateful value along with the ref. That normal state value should
 * be used for any traditional reactive updates.
 *
 * @param {any} initialValue Initial value to set. Omit to start with `undefined`.
 * @returns 3 item tuple of: reference to the value, the stateful value, and function to update both
 * of them. The setter does trigger a state update and potential rerender.
