## Drag and Drop

To support drag and drop in the table set the `hasDragAndDrop` property to true. This will reserve
space in the table for a drag handle at the start of rows. Each draggable row needs to set
`isDraggable` to true in the data array if if can be dragged. Finally, the table will need to supply
callbacks for `onDrag` and `onDrop`.

`onDrag` is called once a drag begins. It receives the the row ID being dragged (and that row's
values for convenience). It must return an object with both an array of row IDs that can accept a
drop of this row, and a `React.Node` to be used as the drag preview. The table will show that
preview near the cursor during the drag, so it should summarize the dragged row in a compact form.
The table will add a border and shadow to this, so just return the row icon and name or something
similar.

`onDrop` is called when a drop succeeds. It receives the dragged row ID and the dropped on row ID.
The caller must decide what to do at that point--the table doesn't change the data on drop. There is
no callback if the drop is canceled.

Note that drag and drop does not work with `StatefulTable` at this time. Use with the standard `Table`.

```js
const columns = [
  {
    id: 'row-0',
    values: {
      name: 'A file',
    }
    isDraggable: true
  },
  {
    id: 'row-1',
    values: {
      name: 'A folder'
    }
  }
]


<Table
  columns={columns}
  data={data}
  options={{ hasDragAndDrop: true }}
  actions={{
    table: {
      onDrag: (rowId, values) => {
        return {
          dropIds: ['row-1'],
          preview: <>values.name</>
        };
      },
      onDrop: (dragRowId, dropRowId) => {
        console.info(`Dropped ${dragRowId} onto ${dropRowId}`);
      }
    },
  }}
/>

];
```
